Pale lager is the most widely consumed and commercially available style of beer in the world. Bock, Pilsner and MÃ¤rzen are all styles of lager.

s2 = Style.create :name => "Ale", :description => "Ale is a type of beer brewed from malted barley using a warm fermentation with a strain of brewers' yeast. The yeast will ferment the beer quickly, giving it a sweet, full bodied and fruity taste. Most ales contain hops, which help preserve the beer and impart a bitter herbal flavour that balances the sweetness of the malt."
s3= Style.create :name => "Porter", :description => "Porter is a dark style of beer originating in London in the 18th century,  descended from brown beer, a well hopped beer made from brown malt. The name is thought to come from its popularity with street and river porters."
